# details

Simple game base with modules system (most like scripts) with dynamic interactions,
works for 2D and 3D.
The build only works for Windows (MinGW GCC), consider having mingw64 installed in default path for
windows (C:/mingw64/).

For compile and run in VS Code:
- 1 Move/copy include/ folder in external/ folder into MinGW/.
- 2 Import this project folder into VS Code.
- 3 Install C++ intellisense and debug tools plugin (Microsoft one).
- 4 Then you will add the tasks (automatically put in VS Code)
- 5 Go to Terminal -> Run Tasks | select compile or run.
- 6 :) <3 wooohhbiii uu

For compile and run in CLion Jetbrains IDE:
- 1 Open the project folder in CLion.
- 2 Build project/construct/refresh or go in file == Reload CMake Project.
- 3 Click in run or debug.
- 4 :))) ,,,!

# disclaimer

I am using this project to learn advanced physic (rigid, mass, friction, euler, verlet, angular velocity, etc).
You can easy make different games in the same project, you can have a 2D game while a 3D game is running.
There is no docs still (also it is not a game engine).

wooohuu!
