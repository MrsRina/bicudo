Hello, the project is not finished yet.

# details

Simple game base with modules system (most like scripts) with dynamic interactions,
works for 2D and 3D (require a minimal change into matrix proj and OpenGL setup).
The project only works for window and uses mingw32, consider having mingw installed in default path for
windows (C:MinGW/).
